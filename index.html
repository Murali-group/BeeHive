BeeHive is a general platform for multiple types of network biology workflows. BeeHive will provide a shared framework and modular components that implement common elements of network biology analyses including installation of algorithms, data pre-processing, cross-validation methods, and network visualization. The BeeHive infrastructure will enable running many network algorithms at scale from a single interface. This strategy will support rigorous benchmarking of network algorithms and greatly simplify testing multiple algorithms on a new biological dataset.
